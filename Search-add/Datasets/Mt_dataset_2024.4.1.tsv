GSE222371	14	Orthogonal metabolism of cellodextrin and xylodextrin is the keystone of synchronous utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose in Myceliophthora thermophila	"Plant biomass holds tremendous potential as a renewable feedstock in the production of biofuels and biochemicals. The effective co-utilization of the main components cellulose and hemicellulose in plant lignocellulose is critical to the economic viability of lignocellulosic biorefineries. Here, we found that the thermophilic cellulolytic fungi Myceliophthora thermophila can utilize cellulose and hemicellulose synchronously. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we firstly checked the soluble carbohydrate of the culture using plant biomass (corncob) as sole carbon source and revealed the presence of various oligosaccharides including cellodextrin and xylodextrin, both intracellularly and extracellularly in the cultures, in addition to glucose or xylose. Based on these, intracellular oligosaccharide metabolism was proposed and confirmed by identification of cellodextrin and xylodextrin metabolism pathway. Furthermore, sugar consumption assay showed that contrasting with synchronous utilization of mixed cello-/xylo-dextrin, the inhibition effect of glucose for the metabolism of xylose and cello-/xylo-dextrin exists in this fungus, suggesting Carbon Catabolite Repression (CCR) is largely avoided at the form of oligosaccharides. Transporter MtCDT-2 showing preference to xylobiose and the tolerance of cellobiose inhibition also helps to bypass metabolic inhibition. Finally, the expression of cellulase and hemicellulase genes, were found orthogonal induction by cellobiose/Avicel and xylobiose/xylan, which conferred the ability of the strain to synchronously utilize cellulose and hemicellulose. Taken together, the orthogonal oligosaccharide catabolic pathway in this fungus establishes the molecular basis for the synchronous utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose, which sheds new light on understanding the plant biomass degradation by fungi and provides alternative paradigm for development of lignocellulose biorefinery such as consolidated bioprocessing in the future."

GSE213575	4	The putative methyltransferase LaeA regulates mycelium growth and cellulase production in Myceliophthora thermophila.	" Filamentous fungi with the ability to use complex carbon sources has been developed as platforms for biochemicals production. Myceliophthora thermophila has been developed as the cell factory to produce lignocellulolytic enzymes and plant biomass-based biofuels and biochemicals in biorefinery. However, low fungal growth rate and cellulose utilization efficiency are significant barriers to the satisfactory yield and productivity of target products, which needs our further exploration and improvement. RESULTS: In this study, we comprehensively explored the roles of the putative methyltransferase LaeA in regulating mycelium growth, sugar consumption, and cellulases expression. Deletion of laeA in thermophile fungus Myceliophthora thermophila enhanced mycelium growth and glucose consumption significantly. Further exploration of LaeA regulatory network indicated that multiple growth regulatory factors (GRF) Cre-1, Grf-1, Grf-2, and Grf-3, which act as negative repressors of carbon metabolism, were regulated by LaeA in this fungus. We also determined that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) is the core node of the metabolic network related to fungal vegetative growth, of which enhancement partially contributed to the elevated sugar consumption and fungal growth of mutant DeltalaeA. Noteworthily, LaeA participated in regulating the expression of cellulase genes and their transcription regulator. DeltalaeA exhibited 30.6% and 5.5% increases in the peak values of extracellular protein and endo-glucanase activity, respectively, as compared to the WT strain. Furthermore, the global histone methylation assays indicated that LaeA is associated with modulating H3K9 methylation levels. The normal function of LaeA on regulating fungal physiology is dependent on methyltransferase activity. CONCLUSIONS: The research presented in this study clarified the function and elucidated the regulatory network of LaeA in the regulation of fungal growth and cellulase production, which will significantly deepen our understanding about the regulation mechanism of LaeA in filamentous fungi and provides the new strategy for improvement the fermentation properties of industrial fungal strain by metabolic engineering."

GSE221464	24	The arabinose transporter MtLat-1 is involved in hemicellulase repression as a pentose transceptor in Myceliophthora thermophila.	" Filamentous fungi possess an array of secreted enzymes to depolymerize the structural polysaccharide components of plant biomass. Sugar transporters play an essential role in nutrient uptake and sensing of extracellular signal molecules to inhibit or trigger the induction of lignocellulolytic enzymes. However, the identities and functions of transceptors associated with the induction of hemicellulase genes remain elusive. RESULTS: In this study, we reveal that the L-arabinose transporter MtLat-1 is associated with repression of hemicellulase gene expression in the filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. The absence of Mtlat-1 caused a decrease in L-arabinose uptake and consumption rates. However, mycelium growth, protein production, and hemicellulolytic activities were markedly increased in a DeltaMtlat-1 mutant compared with the wild-type (WT) when grown on arabinan. Comparative transcriptomic analysis showed a different expression profile in the DeltaMtlat-1 strain from that in the WT in response to arabinan, and demonstrated that MtLat-1 was involved in the repression of the main hemicellulase-encoding genes. A point mutation that abolished the L-arabinose transport activity of MtLat-1 did not impact the repression of hemicellulase gene expression when the mutant protein was expressed in the DeltaMtlat-1 strain. Thus, the involvement of MtLat-1 in the expression of hemicellulase genes is independent of its transport activity. The data suggested that MtLat-1 is a transceptor that senses and transduces the molecular signal, resulting in downstream repression of hemicellulolytic gene expression. MtAra-1 protein directly regulated the expression of Mtlat-1 by binding to its promoter region. Transcriptomic profiling indicated that the transcription factor MtAra-1 also plays an important role in expression of arabinanolytic enzyme genes and L-arabinose catabolism. CONCLUSIONS: M. thermophila MtLat-1 functions as a transceptor that is involved in L-arabinose transport and signal transduction associated with suppression of the expression of hemicellulolytic enzyme-encoding genes. The data presented in this study add to the models of the regulation of hemicellulases in filamentous fungi."

GSE214002	8	The Weimberg pathway: an alternative for Myceliophthora thermophila to utilize D-xylose.	" With D-xylose being the second most abundant sugar in nature, its conversion into products could significantly improve biomass-based process economy. There are two well-studied phosphorylative pathways for D-xylose metabolism. One is isomerase pathway mainly found in bacteria, and the other one is oxo-reductive pathway that always exists in fungi. Except for these two pathways, there are also non-phosphorylative pathways named xylose oxidative pathways and they have several advantages over traditional phosphorylative pathways. In Myceliophthora thermophila, D-xylose can be metabolized through oxo-reductive pathway after plant biomass degradation. The survey of non-phosphorylative pathways in this filamentous fungus will offer a potential way for carbon-efficient production of fuels and chemicals using D-xylose. RESULTS: In this study, an alternative for utilization of D-xylose, the non-phosphorylative Weimberg pathway was established in M. thermophila. Growth on D-xylose of strains whose D-xylose reductase gene was disrupted, was restored after overexpression of the entire Weimberg pathway. During the construction, a native D-xylose dehydrogenase with highest activity in M. thermophila was discovered. Here, M. thermophila was also engineered to produce 1,2,4-butanetriol using D-xylose through non-phosphorylative pathway. Afterwards, transcriptome analysis revealed that the D-xylose dehydrogenase gene was obviously upregulated after deletion of D-xylose reductase gene when cultured in a D-xylose medium. Besides, genes involved in growth were enriched in strains containing the Weimberg pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The Weimberg pathway was established in M. thermophila to support its growth with D-xylose being the sole carbon source. Besides, M. thermophila was engineered to produce 1,2,4-butanetriol using D-xylose through non-phosphorylative pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-phosphorylative pathway recombinant in filamentous fungi, which shows great potential to convert D-xylose to valuable chemicals."

GSE214142	18	PFK2/FBPase-2 is a potential target for metabolic engineering in the filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila.	"The key enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) is responsible for regulating the rates of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in eukaryotes. However, its functions and mechanisms in filamentous fungi remain largely enigmatic. In this study, we systematically investigated the function of this enzyme in Myceliophthora thermophila, a thermophilic filamentous fungus with great capacity to produce industrial enzymes and organic acids. Our results showed that the M. thermophila genome encodes three isomers, all with the PFK2/FBPase-2 structure: pfk2-a, pfk2-b, and pfk2-c. Overexpression of each gene revealed that endogenous expression of pfk2-c (PFK2 activity) promoted glucose metabolism, while overexpression of pfk2-a (FBPase-2 activity) inhibited strain growth. Using knockouts, we found that each gene was individually non-essential, but the triple knockout led to significantly slower growth compared with the wild-type strain. Only the pfk2-a single knockout exhibited 22.15% faster sugar metabolism, exerted through activation of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), thereby significantly promoting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The FBPase-2 deletion mutant strain also exhibited overflow metabolism, and knocking out pfk2-a was proved to be able to improve the production and synthesis rate of various metabolites, such as glycerol and malate. This is the first study to systematically investigate the function of PFK2/FBPase-2 in a thermophilic fungus, providing an effective target for metabolic engineering in filamentous fungi."

GSE205182	18	"MtTRC-1, a Novel Transcription Factor, Regulates Cellulase Production via Directly Modulating the Genes Expression of the Mthac-1 and Mtcbh-1 in Myceliophthora thermophila."	"The thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has been used to produce industrial enzymes and biobased chemicals. In saprotrophic fungi, the mechanisms regulating cellulase production have been studied, which revealed the involvement of multiple transcription factors. However, in M. thermophila, the transcription factors influencing cellulase gene expression and secretion remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel cellulase regulator (MtTRC-1) in M. thermophila through a combination of functional genomics and genetic analyses. Deletion of Mttrc-1 resulted in significantly decreased cellulase production and activities. Transcriptome analysis revealed downregulation of not only the encoding genes of main cellulases but also the transcriptional regulator MtHAC-1 of UPR pathway after disruption of MtTRC-1 under cellulolytic induction conditions. Herein, we also characterized the ortholog of the yeast HAC1p in M. thermophila. We show that Mthac-1 mRNA undergoes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced splicing by removing a 23-nucleotide (nt) intron. Notably, the protein secretion on cellulose was dramatically impaired by the deletion of MtHAC-1. Moreover, the colonial growth on various carbon sources was defective in the absence of MtHAC-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays verified MtTRC-1 regulates the transcription of Mthac-1 and the major cellulase gene Mtcbh-1 by binding directly to the promoters in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, DNase I footprinting assays identified the putative consensus binding site (5'-GNG/C-3'). These results revealed the importance of MtTRC-1 for positively regulating cellulase production. This finding has clarified the complex regulatory pathways involved in cellulolytic enzyme production. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we characterized a novel regulator MtTRC-1 in M. thermophila, which regulated cellulase production through direct transcriptional regulation of the Mthac-1 and Mtcbh-1 genes. Our data demonstrated that MtHAC-1 is a key factor for the cellulase secretion capacity of M. thermophila. Our data indicate that this thermophilic fungus regulates cellulase production through a multilevels network, in which the protein secretory pathway is modulated by MtHAC-1-dependent UPR pathway and the cellulase gene expression is directly regulated in parallel by transcription factors. The conservation of Mttrc1 in filamentous fungi suggests this mechanism may be exploited to engineer filamentous fungal cell factories capable of producing proteins on an industrial scale."

GSE184074	12	Reconstruction and analysis of genome-scale metabolic model for thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila.	"Myceliophthora thermophila, a thermophilic fungus that can degrade and utilize all major polysaccharides in plant biomass, has great potential in biotechnological industries. Here, the first manually curated genome-scale metabolic model iDL1450 for M. thermophila was reconstructed using an autogenerating pipeline with thorough manual curation. The model contains 1450 genes, 2592 reactions, and 1784 unique metabolites. High accuracy was shown in predictions related to carbon and nitrogen source utilization based on data obtained from Biolog experiments. Besides, metabolism profiles were analyzed using iDL1450 integrated with transcriptomics data of M. thermophila at various growth temperatures.

GSE183387	49	"Transcriptomic insights into the roles of the transcription factors Clr1, Clr2 and Clr4 in lignocellulose degradation of the thermophilic fungal platform Thermothelomyces thermophilus"	"Thermothelomyces thermophilus, formerly known as Myceliophthora thermophila, is used in industry to produce lignocellulolytic enzymes and heterologous proteins. However, the transcriptional network driving the expression of these proteins remains elusive. As a first step to systematically uncover this network, we investigated growth, protein secretion, and transcriptomic fingerprints of strains deficient in the cellulolytic transcriptional regulators Clr1, Clr2, and Clr4, respectively. The genes encoding Clr1, Clr2, and Clr4 were individually deleted using split marker or the CRISPR/Cas12a technology and the resulting strains as well as the parental strain were cultivated in bioreactors under chemostat conditions using glucose as carbon source. During steady state conditions, cellulose was added instead of glucose to study the genetic and cellular responses in all four strains to the shift in carbon source availability. Notably, the clr1 and clr2 deletion strains were unable to continue to grow on cellulose, demonstrating a key role of both regulators in cellulose catabolism. Their transcriptomic fingerprints uncovered not only a lack of cellulase gene expression but also reduced expression of genes predicted to encode hemicellulases, pectinases, and esterases. In contrast, the growth of the clr4 deletion strain was very similar compared to the parental strain. However, a much stronger expression of cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases, and esterases was observed. The data gained in this study suggest that both transcriptional regulators Clr1 and Clr2 activate the expression of genes predicted to encode cellulases as well as hemicellulases, pectinases, and esterases. They further suggest that Clr1 controls the basal expression of cellulases and initiates the main lignocellulolytic response to cellulose via induction of clr2 expression. In contrast, Clr4 seems to act as a repressor of the lignocellulolytic response presumably via controlling clr2 expression. Comparative transcriptomics in all four strains revealed potentially new regulators in carbohydrate catabolism and lignocellulolytic enzyme expression that define a candidate gene list for future analyses."

GSE165516	12	Transcriptional Profiling of Myceliophthora thermophila on Galactose and Metabolic Engineering for Improved Galactose Utilization.	"Efficient biological conversion of all sugars from lignocellulosic biomass is necessary for the cost-effective production of biofuels and commodity chemicals. Galactose is one of the most abundant sugar in many hemicelluloses, and it will be important to capture this carbon for an efficient bioconversion process of plant biomass. Thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has been used as a cell factory to produce biochemicals directly from renewable polysaccharides. In this study, we draw out the two native galactose utilization pathways, including the Leloir pathway and oxido-reductive pathway, and identify the significance and contribution of them, through transcriptional profiling analysis of M. thermophila and its mutants on galactose. We find that galactokinase was necessary for galactose transporter expression, and disruption of galK resulted in decreased galactose utilization. Through metabolic engineering, both galactokinase deletion and galactose transporter overexpression can activate internal the oxido-reductive pathway and improve the consumption rate of galactose. Finally, the heterologous galactose-degradation pathway, De Ley-Doudoroff (DLD) pathway, was successfully integrated into M. thermophila, and the consumption rate of galactose in the engineered strain was increased by 57%. Our study focuses on metabolic engineering for accelerating galactose utilization in a thermophilic fungus that will be beneficial for the rational design of fungal strains to produce biofuels and biochemicals from a variety of feedstocks with abundant galactose."

GSE114057	15	Direct production of commodity chemicals from lignocellulose using Myceliophthora thermophila.	"The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable plant biomass has been proposed as a feasible strategy for global sustainable development. However, the economic efficiency of biorefineries is low. Here, through metabolic engineering, Myceliophthora thermophila, a cellulolytic thermophilic fungus, was constructed into a platform that can efficiently convert lignocellulose into important bulk chemicals-four carbon 1, 4-diacids (malic and succinic acid), building blocks for biopolymers-without the need for extra hydrolytic enzymes. Titers of >200__/L from crystalline cellulose and 110__/L from plant biomass (corncob) were achieved during fed-batch fermentation. Our study represents a milestone in consolidated bioprocessing technology and offers a new and promising system for the cost-effective production of chemicals and fuels from biomass."

GSE111986	6	"CLR-4, a novel conserved transcription factor for cellulase gene expression in ascomycete fungi."	"Fungal degradation of lignocellulosic biomass requires various (hemi-)cellulases and is an important part of the natural carbon cycle. Although induction of cellulases has been described for some saprobic filamentous fungi, the regulation of cellulase transcription is complex and many aspects are still poorly understood. Here, we identified and characterized the novel cellulase regulation factor NcCLR-4 in Neurospora crassa and its ortholog MtCLR-4 in Myceliophthora thermophila. Deletion of CLR-4 resulted in similarly defective cellulolytic enzyme production and activities. Transcriptome analyses of DeltaNcclr-4/DeltaMtclr-4 revealed the down-regulation of genes encoding (hemi-)cellulases and pivotal regulators (clr-1, clr-2 and xyr-1) and key genes in the cAMP signaling pathway such as adenylate cyclase Nccr-1. Intracellular cAMP levels were markedly lower in DeltaNcclr-4/DeltaMtclr-4 than in wild-type during cellulose utilization. In electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting assays, NcCLR-4/MtCLR-4 can directly bound to the promoters of Nccr-1/Mtcr-1 (encoding adenylyl cyclase). EMSAs also demonstrated that NcCLR-4/MtCLR-4 could directly bound to clr-1 (encoding a key cellulase regulator), Mtclr-2 and Mtxyr-1 (encoding biomass deconstruction regulators). These findings about the novel cellulase expression regulators NcCLR-4 and MtCLR-4 enrich our understanding of how cellulose degradation is regulated and provide new targets for engineering fungi to deconstruct plant biomass in biorefineries."

GSE137286	20	Myceliophthora thermophila Xyr1 is predominantly involved in xylan degradation and xylose catabolism.	" Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic ascomycete fungus that is used as a producer of enzyme cocktails used in plant biomass saccharification. Further development of this species as an industrial enzyme factory requires a detailed understanding of its regulatory systems driving the production of plant biomass-degrading enzymes. In this study, we analyzed the function of MtXlr1, an ortholog of the (hemi-)cellulolytic regulator XlnR first identified in another industrially relevant fungus, Aspergillus niger. RESULTS: The Mtxlr1 gene was deleted and the resulting strain was compared to the wild type using growth profiling and transcriptomics. The deletion strain was unable to grow on xylan and d-xylose, but showed only a small growth reduction on l-arabinose, and grew similar to the wild type on Avicel and cellulose. These results were supported by the transcriptome analyses which revealed reduction of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes, enzymes of the pentose catabolic pathway and putative pentose transporters. In contrast, no or minimal effects were observed for the expression of cellulolytic genes. CONCLUSIONS: Myceliophthora thermophila MtXlr1 controls the expression of xylanolytic genes and genes involved in pentose transport and catabolism, but has no significant effects on the production of cellulases. It therefore resembles more the role of its ortholog in Neurospora crassa, rather than the broader role described for this regulator in A. niger and Trichoderma reesei. By revealing the range of genes controlled by MtXlr1, our results provide the basic knowledge for targeted strain improvement by overproducing or constitutively activating this regulator, to further improve the biotechnological value of M. thermophila."

"Thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has great capacity for biomass degradation and is an attractive option for use as cell factory to produce chemicals directly from renewable polysaccharides, such as starch, rather than monomer glucose. To date, there has been no transcriptomic analysis of this thermophilic fungus on starch. This study determined the transcriptomic profile of M. thermophila responding to soluble starch and a 342-gene set was identified as a ""starch regulon"", including the major amylolytic enzyme (Mycth_72393). Its overexpression led to increased amylase activities on starch by 35%. Furthermore, overexpressing the key amylolytic enzyme regulator AmyR in M. thermophila significantly increased amylase activity by 30%. Deletion of amyR by the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to the relief of carbon catabolite repression and 3-fold increased lignocellulase activities on cellulose. This study will accelerate rational fungal strain engineering for biochemical production from biomass substrates such as raw corn starch and even crop straw."

GSE57235	4	Transcriptome and exoproteome analysis of utilization of plant-derived biomass by Myceliophthora thermophila.	"Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic fungus whose genome encodes a wide range of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) involved in plant biomass degradation. Such enzymes have potential applications in turning different kinds of lignocellulosic feedstock into sugar precursors for biofuels and chemicals. The present study examined and compared the transcriptomes and exoproteomes of M. thermophila during cultivation on different types of complex biomass to gain insight into how its secreted enzymatic machinery varies with different sources of lignocellulose. In the transcriptome analysis three monocot (barley, oat, triticale) and three dicot (alfalfa, canola, flax) plants were used whereas in the proteome analysis additional substrates, i.e. wood and corn stover pulps, were included. A core set of 59 genes encoding CAZymes was up-regulated in response to both monocot and dicot straws, including nine polysaccharide monooxygenases and GH10, but not GH11, xylanases. Genes encoding additional xylanolytic enzymes were up-regulated during growth on monocot straws, while genes encoding additional pectinolytic enzymes were up-regulated in response to dicot biomass. Exoproteome analysis was generally consistent with the conclusions drawn from transcriptome analysis, but additional CAZymes that accumulated to high levels were identified. Despite the wide variety of biomass sources tested some CAZy family members were not expressed under any condition. The results of this study provide a comprehensive view from both transcriptome and exoproteome levels, of how M. thermophila responds to a wide range of biomass sources using its genomic resources."

"Thermostable enzymes and thermophilic cell factories may afford economic advantages in the production of many chemicals and biomass-based fuels. Here we describe and compare the genomes of two thermophilic fungi, Myceliophthora thermophila and Thielavia terrestris. To our knowledge, these genomes are the first described for thermophilic eukaryotes and the first complete telomere-to-telomere genomes for filamentous fungi. Genome analyses and experimental data suggest that both thermophiles are capable of hydrolyzing all major polysaccharides found in biomass. Examination of transcriptome data and secreted proteins suggests that the two fungi use shared approaches in the hydrolysis of cellulose and xylan but distinct mechanisms in pectin degradation. Characterization of the biomass-hydrolyzing activity of recombinant enzymes suggests that these organisms are highly efficient in biomass decomposition at both moderate and high temperatures. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that aside from representing a potential reservoir of thermostable enzymes, thermophilic fungi are amenable to manipulation using classical and molecular genetics."
